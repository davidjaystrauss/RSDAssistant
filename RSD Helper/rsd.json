It's been so enjoayable that we thought we should document the group playing Williams music live in a studio. This document is not in anyway trying to compete with the amazing work that William Onyeabor did originally. This is a limited LP only edition which we hope you enjoy.

Fresh off of their collaboration with Marvel Comics, Czarface has not only delivered a new audio adventure complete with narration, it has given us an extra large, full color, action-packed 24 page comic book with it, housed in a beautiful gatefold jacket!

Marianne Faithfull had this to say about the 1971 recordings: \"The record itself is very strange and ghostly. It\"s the voice of somebody incredibly high, probably on the edge of death.

But the classic American music that Graffin pays homage to here, in both carefully chosen covers and in his own songwriting, forms the backbone of Bad Religion's epic tales of the young and the poor, mired by misery and poverty. Cold as the Clay honors the traditional folk music that Graffin grew up listening to, with original rock compositions that drew inspiration from the folk rock of Gram Parsons and Neil Young, as well as traditional American Folk music. The album was produced by Brett Gurewitz and features guest performances by singer Jolie Holland and The Wearkerthans as backing musicians. In celebration of both the 10th anniversary of this release and the 10th Record Store Day, Cold as the Clay will be pressed on LP for the first time, in a limited run of metallica gold vinyl."

During this crazy time, though, the band tries to keep level heads: they try to remember where they are coming from, and at the root of it, what the songs are really saying. Thus, Song Seeds was born. This Record Store Day exclusive 10\" includes three versions of two tracks from Cleopatra, each recorded at a different point in the song's life. There's the \"seed\", which is the early demo version, the album cut and a live version pulled from of the shows on the tour. This particular record features seeds of \"Angela\" and \"Long Way From Home\" and it's a great piece for anyone who loves the band and wants to feel a part of their creative process."

Any purchase of these two songs will go to support the work of Everytown For Gun Safety - an organization I have followed for quite some time.

              "More Info": "Tidal Waves Music presents exclusively for Record Store Day 2017: NICO & THE FACTION \"THE LAST SESSIONS\" NICO needs little introduction \" she was a singer-songwriter, composer, model (for \"Vogue\", \"Elle\" & \"Coco Channel\"), actress (she starred in Federico Fellini's masterpiece \"La Dolce Vita\") and Andy Warhol superstar in the 1960s.Collaborations were numerous and the most famous ones include those with BRIAN JONES, VELVET UNDERGROUND, SERGE GAINSBOURG, BRIAN ENO, BOB DYLAN and MARC ALMOND. The experimental and dismal sound of her albums is considered the forerunner of the later \"gothic\" sound. Nico was admired, cited as a major influence and paid tribute to by many musicians such as Siouxsie & the Banshees, Bauhaus, Patti Smith, Morrissey, Bj_rk, Leonard Cohen, Henry Rollins and Marianne Faithfull. This album documents Nico\"s last ever performance held on June 6, 1988 in West Berlin as part of the European Capital of Culture festival that year. Except for the album's closing song (which was previously released on The End...), Nico and her backing band \"The Faction\" composed all the pieces specifically for the show. As the title of the album indicates, the concert was Nico's last, and the material on the album is among the last she (co-)wrote. Six weeks later, on July 18, she died while on vacation in Ibiza. This is a stunning album. The last stand of an exceptional artist, shortly before her untimely tragic death, who lived an exceptional life overshadowed by a 15 year struggle with heroin addiction. Originally released on CD in 1994, this is the first time the soundtrack gets a vinyl release outside of Europe. Now available as a gorgeously packaged deluxe DOUBLE vinyl edition, exclusively for Record Store Day 2017. Strictly limited to 1500 copies, this release also comes with an insert featuring extensive liner notes & background information."

By the time they triumphantly walked off the stage, they were one of the festival\"s biggest surprises. Santana delivered a career-making performance melding Latin rock and bruising blues that set the stage for their platinum-selling debut album, released weeks later. Now, Santana Live At The Woodstock Music & Art Fair, August 16, 1969 takes listeners back to that show-stopping set, pressed on vinyl for the first time."

The band was founded in 1967 and after recruiting vocalist Mariska Veres they soon became huge. With their single \"Venus\" they became the first Dutch band ever to reach the first spot on the American Billboard Hot 100. The band had a series of subsequent hits but decided to call it a day in 1975. Their influence reached well beyond their generation: even bands like Nirvana and The Prodigy used Shocking Blue's \"Love Buzz\". At Home contains both \"Venus\" as well as \"Love Buzz\". Furthermore this legendary album features 4 bonus tracks that were previously available as b-sides on various long out of print 45s. In celebration of Record Store Day 2017, the album is pressed on coloured vinyl for the first time ever. The worldwide imited edition of 2500 individually numbered copies is pressed on \"Shocking Blue\" coloured vinyl."

Part of Andy Warhol's Factory for a year in the mid-'60s, she is widely believed to have inspired The Velvet Underground's \"Femme Fatale\" as well as Bob Dylan's \"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\" and \"Just Like A Woman\". 1973's Ciao! Manhattan, the model and actor's final film, gave some indication of why she inspired such devotion. Written and directed by Factory affiliates John Palmer and David Weisman, the movie tells a quasi-fictionalised account _ a chronicle \" clef in Weisman's words _ of Sedgewick's journey from New York to Santa Barbara. In the film, Sedgwick is Susan Superstar, a New Yorker who winds up living in a drained Santa Barbara swimming pool in a narcotic daze, life and art just a hair away from each other. Shot over a five year period, Sedgwick died of a barbiturate overdose at the age of 28 before filming wrapped in 1971. For a movie starring some of rock's great muses, the soundtrack fittingly features cult figures of the era: Richie Havens (\"Shouldn't All The World Be Dancing\", \"To Give All Your Love Away\", \"I Can\"t Make It Anymore\"), John Phillips (\"Malibu People\") and Byrds/Flying Burrito Brothers member Skip Battin, who performs Kim Fowley's \"Citizen Kane\". Other artists are less well-known, including actor Kim Milford, who sings the stirring \"Justice\", and Factory man Gino Piserchio, an artist and dear friend of Weisman, whose synthesizer compositions anchor the score. Never before released in any format, this long-overdue pressing includes all of the above plus selected dialogue from the film, each snippet like a beat poem in its own way. The Village Voice once called Ciao! \"The Citizen Kane of the drug generation\"; deeply evocative of the era, the mood of the soundtrack captures the psychedelic spirit of the film, as well as the darkness and tragedy that characterized Edie's life."

Yes, we realize how absurd that probably sounds to most ears, but it\"s really true: American country & western records have been tremendously popular and deeply beloved across the continent for almost a century. The people of the West African nation of Nigeria have long been not only voracious consumers of country music, but fairly enthusiastic performers of it as well. Cowboy songs have remained a consistent part of most bands\" live repertoire, but relatively few artists have dedicated themselves to actually recording country music. They did exist, though; mostly in the1970s and 80s, but they were rarely heard outside the country, and in the intervening years, most of their output has fallen through the cracks of posterity, forgotten even by ardent music fans at home. Until now. Like Nashville in Naija: Nigeria\"s Romance with Country Music, Yesterday and Today collects some of the best country recordings as a loving tribute to Nigeria\"s cowboy troubadours of yore."

Building on the distorted electric guitar sound of early records, his 1958 instrumental hit \"Rumble\" (banned in New York and Boston for fear it would incite teenage gang violence) popularized \"the power chord\" which laid the foundation to modern rock music.Building on the distorted electric guitar sound of early records, his 1958 instrumental hit \"Rumble\" (banned in New York and Boston for fear it would incite teenage gang violence) popularized \"the power chord\" which laid the foundation to modern rock music.This is where the \"Beans and Fatback\" sessions were recorded in 1971, making it part of what we now know as the \"Shack Trilogy\" together with the albums \"Link Wray\" & \"Mordicai Jones\".Producer Steve Verroca had, allegedly, stolen the demo tapes of Beans and Fatback and sold them to Virgin Records who later withdrew the album.Beans and Fatback is made out of fantastic Americana blended blues, country, gospel, Native American chants, folk rock and traditionals such as \"Hobo Man\" and \"Georgia Pines\" (the latter a rewrite of Lead Belly\"s \"In the Pines).Link Wray leaves a legacy as big as his career: Rolling Stone placed Wray at No. 45 of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time and in 2013 he was a nominee for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pete Townshend of The Who once said, \"If it hadn't been for Link Wray and 'Rumble,' I never would have picked up a guitar.\" Other musicians citing him as a major influence are Iggy Pop, Neil Young & Jimmy Page (amongst others).Originally released on Virgin Records in 1973, this is the first time the album gets a vinyl release outside of Europe. Now available as a gorgeously packaged deluxe vinyl edition, exclusively for Record Store Day 2017. Strictly limited to 2500 copies."
