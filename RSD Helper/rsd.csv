Part of Andy Warhol's Factory for a year in the mid-'60s, she is widely believed to have inspired The Velvet Underground's –Femme Fatale” as well as Bob Dylan's –Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat” and –Just Like A Woman”. 1973's Ciao! Manhattan, the model and actor's final film, gave some indication of why she inspired such devotion. Written and directed by Factory affiliates John Palmer and David Weisman, the movie tells a quasi-fictionalised account _ a chronicle š clef in Weisman's words _ of Sedgewick's journey from New York to Santa Barbara. In the film, Sedgwick is Susan Superstar, a New Yorker who winds up living in a drained Santa Barbara swimming pool in a narcotic daze, life and art just a hair away from each other. Shot over a five year period, Sedgwick died of a barbiturate overdose at the age of 28 before filming wrapped in 1971. For a movie starring some of rock's great muses, the soundtrack fittingly features cult figures of the era: Richie Havens (–Shouldn't All The World Be Dancing”, –To Give All Your Love Away”, –I Canêt Make It Anymore”), John Phillips (–Malibu People”) and Byrds/Flying Burrito Brothers member Skip Battin, who performs Kim Fowley's –Citizen Kane”.

Never before released in any format, this long-overdue pressing includes all of the above plus selected dialogue from the film, each snippet like a beat poem in its own way.

Building on the distorted electric guitar sound of early records, his 1958 instrumental hit ""Rumble"" (banned in New York and Boston for fear it would incite teenage gang violence) popularized ""the power chord” which laid the foundation to modern rock music.Building on the distorted electric guitar sound of early records, his 1958 instrumental hit ""Rumble"" (banned in New York and Boston for fear it would incite teenage gang violence) popularized ""the power chord” which laid the foundation to modern rock music.This is where the •Beans and Fatbackê sessions were recorded in 1971, making it part of what we now know as the •Shack Trilogyê together with the albums •Link Wrayê & •Mordicai Jonesê.Producer Steve Verroca had, allegedly, stolen the demo tapes of Beans and Fatback and sold them to Virgin Records who later withdrew the album.Beans and Fatback is made out of fantastic Americana blended blues, country, gospel, Native American chants, folk rock and traditionals such as •Hobo Manê and •Georgia Pinesê (the latter a rewrite of Lead Bellyês •In the Pines).Link Wray leaves a legacy as big as his career: Rolling Stone placed Wray at No. 45 of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time and in 2013 he was a nominee for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pete Townshend of The Who once said, ""If it hadn't been for Link Wray and 'Rumble,' I never would have picked up a guitar."" Other musicians citing him as a major influence are Iggy Pop, Neil Young & Jimmy Page (amongst others).Originally released on Virgin Records in 1973, this is the first time the album gets a vinyl release outside of Europe.
