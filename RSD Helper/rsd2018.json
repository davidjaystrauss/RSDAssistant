 "More Info": "Anywhere II is the second, proper full length release from musical entity Anywhere, following their 2012 self-titled release. The sound began with two friends Christian Eric Beaulieu and Cedric Bixler Zavala (The Mars Volta) digging into open tuning and hybrid ragas with punk energy. The project evolved into an expansive, bizarrely curated cavalcade of A-list psychedelic exhibitionists from all parts California, and a few world famous musicians playing non-famous instruments, all arranged and overseen by a mostly unknown, humble guitar playing surfer dude. The line-up of \"II\" finds Beaulieu and Zavala accompanied by Krist Novoselic,  Mike Watt,  Dale Crover, Jonathan Hischke, and many others. No where else in the world can you find a recording with members of Comets On Fire, Nirvana, Earthless, Melvins, Flying Luttenbachers, Sleepy Sun, Triclops!, Devendra Banhart, Lieutenant, Golden, Black Fork, Victims Family, The Mars Volta,  fIREHOSE, AND a winner of America's Next Top Model.

 "More Info": "James Thomas Ramey, better known by his stage name Baby Huey (taken from the Paramount Pictures animated giant cartoon duckling) was born in Richmond, Indiana and moved to Chicago in the early '60s to front his band The Babysitters with co-founders Melvin Deacon Jones on trumpet and Johnny Ross on guitar. By the time they recorded The Living Legend, only Huey and Jones remained (Deacon Jones would go on to play with Freddie King and John Lee Hooker). Because of a glandular disorder, Huey weighed close to 400 pounds at times, contributing to his \"larger than life\" stage presence, but also to a host of health issues. During the later '60s, The Babysitters followed Sly and the Family Stone's lead and became a psychedelic soul act, with Huey adding rhymes to their stage act. Curtis Mayfield, tipped off by Donny Hathaway, came to check them out and they were in the midst of recording The Living Legend for his label when Huey died in a hotel room, just a few weeks after Jimi Hendrix. It became a posthumous release. Fast forward a few years to Kool Herc (one of the original hip-hop DJs, who began to spin two copies of \"Listen To Me\" at the same time---starting the Baby Huey cult, and leading to \"Hard Times\" being sampled by the likes of A Tribe Called Quest and Ice Cube. The lacquers for this RSD 2018 release were cut directly from the analog tapes by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering, and pressed on 180g vinyl at Record Industry. It comes in a tip-on Stoughton jacket and includes a bonus LP of unreleased instrumentals making their vinyl debut."

The band's debut single, \"Laugh Laugh\" helped break them into the mainstream and would later be cited as helping to establish the San Francisco Sound. By 1968, Sal Valentine (lead vocals) and guitarist Ron Elliottt were a duo when they stepped into Owen Bradley's studio in Mt. Juliet, TN, about a half hour outside Nashville. With legendary producer Lenny Waronker in tow and backed by some of Nashville's finest session musicians, they conjured up an intimate and heartbreaking final stop on their five year journey from British-folk rockers to alternative country obscurity. What they created was like nothing else and has stood the test of time. This deluxe expanded edition for Record Store Day pulls together the homespun, inviting and timeless music created in Bradley's Barn and adds a bonus LP of demo recordings that are finally making their debut on vinyl."

The legacy of Chuck Berry is nearly beyond description-–Berry means originality, being the first true rock and rolling, gyrating guitar god, and the earliest rock and roll lyricist whose words are worthy of a poet's pedigree. And Berry means success, too...all of the dozen recordings on this long play record were hit recordings, from the beginning (\"Maybelline,\" in the summer of '55) to the most recent waxing (the fun and funky \"Nadine\"), both supercharged tales featuring cars and girls, subjects close to the singer's heart. Here are a dozen of his monumental achievements: guitar-driven, rocking, rolling music with his hip, happening wit and genius wordsmithing–Chuck Berry's Greatest Hits!"

For the most part, the music is original, some co-written with a number of master songwriters, including Bill Miller, Shawn Camp, and Wesley Orbison. Much of the production is sparse and simple, focusing on the song and the individual instrumentalist.

Begging to be listened to on noise-canceling headphones or very, very loud speakers, the duo blast off with a drum track that is instantly, almost comically subsumed into a nine-minute sound-cleanse of bells, drones, and a soaring rocket flare that may be a guitar. Ambient but hardly static, its tones and textures return throughout, as if tracing long and inaudibly developing melodies. Not immediately identifiable as either Eno or Shields' work, a rich, enveloping piece of music\" - Pitchfork."

 "More Info": "Horrorcore hip-hop veterans Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope of Insane Clown Posse have never been one to avoid controversy for the sake of their craft. The release of their 1997 album The Great Milenko proved that, when the album's label, Disney-owned Hollywood Records, removed the album from shelves mere hours after its release to appease complaints by the Southern Baptist Church. This controversy only served to propel the Detroit duo's profile higher, as numerous labels lined up to court them. By 1998 Insane Clown Posse had settled into Island Records, and The Great Milenko had sold over one million copies, setting the stage for their next record. The Amazing Jeckel Brothers was released in 1999, was the fifth entry into their \"Joker's Cards\" anthology of albums, and featured 17 tracks touching on themes of anger, morality, and sin, heavily inspired by the negative press the group has received from the Hollywood Records debacle. Like Milenko, the album featured production from their frequent collaborator DJ Mike E. Clark, but Jeckel Brothers set itself apart with its sound, heavily indebted to classic 90s rap, as opposed to Milenko's hard rock-influence, featuring key contributions from legends of hip-hop like Ol' Dirty Bastard and Snoop Dogg, from fellow horrorcore icons Twiztid, ska-revival band Gangsta Fun, and even prank call comedians The Jerky Boys. Despite receiving a thrashing from critics, Insane Clown Posse defied the press it received, when The Amazing Jeckel Brothers debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200 charts, and ultimately reached platinum status in 2008. In celebration of this landmark album, Insane Clown Posse's own Psychopathic Records now presents this special reissue of The Amazing Jeckel Brothers. Not just on vinyl for the very first time, but pressed on transparent red wax, and housed in two variant covers featuring each of the two iconic Jeckel Brothers from the original artwork."

 "More Info": "Recorded at London's legendary Olympic Studios during the heady days of the 'Summer of Love,' in a landscape of fervent creativity – Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper, Hendrix, the Velvet Underground, and the Who – Satanic Majesties stands out as a dramatic landmark. The band's first full venture into the world of 'psychedelia,' it may have split critical opinion at the time, but is long overdue for reassessment – an innovative and experimental piece, as much influenced by Coltrane, John Barry's spy thriller scores, and classical composers as the blues and R&B of previous releases. Produced by the band, engineered by Glyn Johns, and with string arrangements by John Paul Jones, it features some of their most imaginative soundscapes, which included African rhythms, mellotrons, 'found voices,' and full orchestration. Amongst the song highlights are the beautiful She's A Rainbow, with its elegant harmonies, piano intro, and strings, the powerful, riff-driven Citadel, and the imposingly dark, cosmic rocker 2000 Light Years From Home, with its sinister keyboard effects (courtesy of Brian). It also features Bill Wyman's debut writing and singing credit on a Stones release – In Another Land. The pioneering packaging – a 'lenticular' sleeve with a 3D-style Michael Cooper image of the band - and the album's title (a mocking adaptation of the wording, 'Her Britannic Majesty Requests and Requires...' on British passports), both confirmed the group's creative intent and also its satirical attitude.

They reflect in each layer of our being. In order to have clearness in our head, we need to clear our hearts. The Calling is the soul telling me to return. Ground. She is the birth of all that is.

They did the unexpected when they re-recorded every song on the album in a completely different style and reversed the running order for The Worms Heart released last month. \"The top-line melody remains intact, but everything else - the instrumentation, tempo - is altered.\" - The Guardian. This split 12\" titled Los Lobos vs. The Shins features three distinct versions of their song, the Fear; the original booming, sweeping track from Heartworms; the second kinetic \"flipped\" version from The Worm's Heart; and the final rendition, heavy on the heartstrings, is from buddy-band Los Lobos, which took vital form while the two groups played out together. In Mercer's words, Los Lobos \"just destroyed our version.\""

 "More Info": "Director Luca Guadagnino of the worldwide movie hit Call me by Your Name found himself resonating with Sufjan Stevens' lyricism through his work and initially asked Stevens to record an original song. Eventually, Stevens contributed three songs to the Call me By Your Name soundtrack: \"Visions of Gideon\", which was used at a very emotional scene at the end of the film, \"Mystery of Love,\" for which a video was made and a new rendition of \"Futile Devices\" with piano. Stevens penned the songs by using the script, the book, and the conversations with the director about the characters. It marks Sufjan Stevens' first soundtrack for a feature film. For the song \"Mystery of Love\" he received an Academy Award nomination in 2018. The first pressing of The Mystery Of Love 10\" EP is pressed on transparent vinyl.

The American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens is well known for creating deeply personal songs with an understanding of the power of melodies and emotional impact. He started back in the 90's and released his first album in 2000, called A Sun Came. It's the album in which he introduced himself to the world as a musician who never let any of his feelings float away. He just integrates it into his rhythms and melodies, from electronica and folk to indie and rock. In 2005 he brought his album Illinois to life, a masterpiece which reached number one on the Billboard charts. Call Me By Your Name, the multiple award winning movie by Luca Guadagnino, is a sensual and transcendent tale of first love, based on the acclaimed novel by André Aciman. Summer of 1983, Northern Italy. An American-Italian is enamored by an American student who comes to study and live with his family.

The other five tracks, which feature, among others, Ra's longtime associate John Gilmore on tenor saxophone, were recorded at the Choreographer's Workshop rehearsal space in 1962 and 1963.

Wyman also co-wrote their signature tune, the psychedelic classic \"Shades Of Orange\", although the band wrote all the rest of their material.

 "More Info": "\"In my category, I'm the one and only,\" proclaimed Oakland legend Too $hort on his 1990 single \"Short But Funky.\" Few disagreed then, and even fewer would do so decades later. First appearing in the mid-1980s slinging homemade tapes out of his car trunk, the man born Todd Shaw has always stayed true to himself. And although he is known more for the dirty side of his rap game, on \"Short But Funky\" he also reminds listeners of an important fact: \"There's a serious side to everything I say.\" Short Dog's In The House was $hort's sixth album, and his second for the Jive label. By the time it hit, he was a West Coast legend, but his rep was growing Eastwards, as the rest of the country started opening its ears to new sounds. Peaking at #20 on the national Billboard 200 chart, the album was exactly what his dedicated fans expected – funky, 70s-drenched beats made for cars on the boulevard; and no-nonsense lyrics that made more sense and dropped more knowledge than he was ever given credit for. For examples of his conscious side, look no further than the P-Funk fueled \"It's Your Life\" or the album's lead single, \"The Ghetto.\" The album's second single \"Short But Funky\" landed somewhere in the middle of $hort and Todd Shaw, talking about where he was at as the new decade broke, and making it clear that he wasn't going anywhere. His mortality was particularly on his mind after rumors had surfaced the year before that he had died in a crackhouse. He speaks directly to this crazy episode on \"Dead Or Alive.\" And although it's mostly a solo affair, he brings in some heavy artillery – and a lot of not-for-the-kids profanity – on \"Ain't Nothin' But A Word To Me,\" featuring none other than Ice Cube. In between, $hort distributed plenty of tales and charisma for fans to eat up, continuing to build his legendary status as one of the rap trailblazers of the era. Presented here on black wax with a poster of the excellent cartoon cover graphic, it's time to give this one a spin, whether it's the first or 100th time."

It was about innovation and moving forward. We loved the look, the attitude, the edge and the back to basics approach. We were the audience and the bands were mostly the same age as us. The energy and excitement feeding from stage to fans and back again was palpable... This set is a testament to the vital role that Punk music, and all that it spawned, has played in each of our lives.\""

On this album, there comes together an assort-ed and wondrous host of musical guests, from some of the most recorded Nashville session players ever, to visionary recording artists from the bluegrass, rock, and country music world. For the most part, the music is original, some co-written with a number of master songwriters, including Bill Miller, Shawn Camp, and Wesley Orbison. Much of the production is sparse and simple, focusing on the song and the individual instrumentalist. But John Carter certainly holds no limit or containment around his creative energy, and this double-album is certainly diverse and presents an unparalleled epic journey."

 "More Info": "There are West Coast classics, and then there is Music To Driveby, the third LP from the group that birthed MC Eiht: Compton's Most Wanted. Although the group started in the late '80s with multiple MCs (including Tha Chill and Boom Bam), by 1992 Eight was pulling the group's vocal weight – supported by DJ Mike T on turntables and production – and even producing and co-producing tracks. Music To Driveby might lack beats-per-minute variety, but to fans that's not a bad thing. Across the board, this is mid-tempo, super deep, funky hip-hop, made for cars creeping along boulevards across the West and South, and it's about as good as it gets for such purposes. Just about filler-free, the album struts intensely and with purpose, as Eiht throws tales of Cali street life at fans for an hour straight, almost without a break. This solo marathon is given a respite only once, with Scarface's guest spot on \"N 2 Deep,\" an excellent hood roller supported by a soulful guitar lick sampled from Lyn Collins' \"Do Your Thing.\" Elsewhere, Eiht rolls alone and intensely, on cuts like the classic smash single \"Hood Took Me Under\"; the album's second single and Tim Dog attack \"Who's Fu**ing Who?\"; the hometown big-up \"Compton 4 Life\"; and hustle tales like \"Jack Mode\" and \"I Gots To Get Over.\" After this album, Eiht released more classics under his own name, and with similar fan worship. It was the continuation of a legendary career and Music To Driveby still ranks high on anyone's \"West Coast Legends\" playlist. THIS RELEASE WILL BE DISTRIBUTED NATIONWIDE BUT WILL PRIMARILY BE FOUND IN CALIFORNIA RECORD STORES."

Davis taught Jimi Hendrix how to play the guitar (really), and he was personally invited by Elvis Presley to perform with him at Graceland. He was a close personal friend to Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson, and he rubbed shoulders with a member of the Manson family who secretly toured with Ballard in the 1980s under a different name. He's in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as he should be.

 "More Info": "Florian Fricke (1944 – 2001) was a German music pioneer who started his career in electronic music using the Moog synthesizer within the famous Krautrock group 'Popol Vuh'. Fricke studied piano, composition and directing at the conservatories in Freiburg and Munich where he also dedicated himself to new kinds of music like 'free jazz'. In 1967 he met German film director Werner Herzog and the two formed a life long friendship (Fricke was later responsible for the soundtracks of several of Herzog's movies). His recordings left an indelible mark on German electronic music. However, he later significantly gave his Moog to fellow German musician Klaus Schulze and largely renounced electronic music in favor of often-acoustic tones. Besides working on his own music, Fricke collaborated with many German musicians & bands like Tangerine Dream & Amon Düül. Over the course of his career Florian put out countless Popol Vuh albums and two solo albums, the first one being 'Die Erde und ich sind Eins' (1983) and in 1991 he recorded an intimate album of Mozart compositions. Fricke plays a beautiful selection of his favourite Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Allegro's & Adagio's on 'Spielt Mozart' (plays Mozart). A very personal album for Florian, it was released as a tribute for the 200th anniversary of Mozart's death. Trying to achieve a deep inner-peace, Fricke looses himself completely in the vibrations and wonderful melodies. The result here is a honest interpretation without pretence or hidden motives, a tribute from one composer to another, almost like a dialogue between the two. Now, for the FIRST TIME ON VINYL (these recordings only received a limited CD release in the early nineties) OWS records proudly presents a deluxe double vinyl edition exclusively for Record Store Day 2018. Strictly limited to 1000 copies, available in participating stores on 4/21."

 "More Info": "Double Date is an independent British horror film that was released to great applause in 2017. The film was written by and starred Danny Morgan and was the debut movie directed by Benjamin Barfoot. Ben approached Goat in 2016 asking them if they would be interested in appearing in the film he was making as he had a club scene where he wanted to feature a band playing live. And when he and Danny were coming up with the idea for the movie they had Goat's 'World Music' album on repeat and it was the band's infectious tribal grooves that he wanted in the scene. During filming of Goat's scene Ben and the band bonded and he invited Goat to score the whole film, so their unique DNA would be running throughout the whole picture. The band liked the idea and decided to take the challenge on. And we at Rocket are very excited to be able to release the complete score Goat created for the film on a special ltd edition 'pool of blood' coloured vinyl 10\" LP especially for Record Store Day 2018. The album contains all the original music Goat created to soundtrack the film plus the music they made for the trailer. The score also contains a different version of Goat's live anthem 'Run To Your Mama' that was especially created for the film."

His lyrics have always been imbued with a strong affinity for the transcendental, and this album is no exception, with the music ranging from dark Jim Carroll/Leonard Cohen-ish lamentations (\"Things You Cannot Control\") to bluesy r&b rock (\"Here With You\") and emphatic rockers (\"13th Level\" and the title track). Scrambled Eggs is the follow-up record to his first solo album, A WORLD OF PEACE which was produced by Brian Wilson in 1967. It features a dozen new songs by Stevie, cowritten with friends like Dylan LeBlanc, Tara Holloway, Ellis Hooks, Robert \"Butch\" Johnson, and producer Jon Tiven. Stevie's poetic sensibilities shine forth, and he is joined by singing partners Black Francis, Bekka Bramlett, Ellis Hooks and the aforementioned Dylan LeBlanc and Tara Holloway.

 "More Info": "A crucial founding member of the Northern Cali-birthed Solesides / Quannum collective – which included DJ Shadow and Blackalicious, among others – and one half of the groundbreaking Latyrx duo (with Lateef The Truthspeaker), Lyrics Born opened a lot of ears and minds with his 2003 solo debut, Later That Day. On this very open-minded and chiefly self-produced long player, Lyrics Born and his crew (including Joyo Velarde, on vocals; guitarist Tommy Guerrero and Germany's funk masters Poets of Rhythm) bring it from the funk side, boasting a warm soul stew instead of colder drum machine-based beats and chopped samples. As shown since his earliest days, the incredibly versatile Lyrics Born mixes his flow up depending on the track, from tongue-twistingly fast to conversationally mundane, and concepts are usually at the forefront – \"Cold Call\" is an amusing take on telemarketers, featuring Gift of Gab; \"Before And After\" is about friends growing apart; \"Bad Dreams\" is a groovy apocalyptic shaker. The infectious \"Callin' Out\" rides the party train and \"Stop Complaining\" timeshares between funny and serious. \"Do That There\" features DJ Cut Chemist with liquid cuts that work around LB's verbal floor routine. And even after all of the other musical fireworks, the album's crescendo most assuredly comes on track eleven, \"The Last Trumpet\": operatically dramatic and powerful, with Lyrics Born and Latyrx-mate Lateef trading verses like \"the only action / we can profit from / is movement towards / the positive / progressive thought / that's rooted up / in consciousness\" at breakneck pace. Presented for its 15th Anniversary as a 2-LP set, on colored vinyl, housed in a gatefold jacket with in-depth liner notes by renowned author and journalist Jeff Chang (who also helped found the Solesides movement in the early '90s), plus an 11\"x17\" poster of the amazing cover art, this is a perfect way to re-introduce this classic to a new era of fans – present and future. THIS RELEASE WILL BE DISTRIBUTED NATIONWIDE BUT WILL PRIMARILY BE FOUND IN CALIFORNIA RECORD STORES."

Lovingly overseen by Hayes and recent collaborator Pat Sansone (Wilco/The Autumn Defense), it will finally be available on the format it should've always been, this Record Store Day 2018. Remastered and presented as a double LP - cut specially at 45rpm – it comes housed in a beautiful gatefold jacket with expanded artwork throughout. Its expansive, singular vision infamously took years to realise, involving Earth Wind & Fire's horn arranger (the legendary Tom Tom MMLXXXIV) amongst other elite personnel. Recorded with five different engineers (including Steve Albini and John McEntire), Hayes meticulously extracted every ounce of pop from each note. A long list of renowned studio ringers (including soul drummer Morris Jennings) and Chicago regulars (McEntire, Rizzo, Parker) among many others provide playing of demonstrably professional precision. As such, Hayes' complex, meandering melodies are rendered far more coherent and satisfying than they otherwise might have appeared, bringing his epic, anguished pop to a rarely seen level of perfection and depth. This unstinting dedication to the overarching vision was rewarded handsomely - artistically, at least. However, as might have been expected, his deluxe approach resulted in a bill too steep for any American or European label to ultimately support. It has since seemed unlikely that it would see the light of day on either side of the Atlantic. Yet we were determined not to allow Hayes' lifetime achievement to go unnoticed or let music fans across the world miss out on one of the finest albums of this century. A wide-eyed opus of stunning intensity, Fed oozes Hayes' impeccable influences without ever becoming overwhelmed by them. Incredibly, it touches upon Blaxploitation soul, Boz Scaggs-soft-rock, hints of jazz and blues, timeless baroque and skewed pop. In one long minute, the stabbing, soulful \"So Blind\" moves through five different melodic segments; horns shift easily from haunting backdrop to explosive forefront, smoothly giving way to strings as Hayes' voice casts its bewitching spell. The ambitious soul of \"Having It All\" has been described as the diffident cousin of Marvin Gaye's \"Save The Children\" whilst the breezy \"Greyhound Bus Station\" is pure 70s AM Gold, evoking the easy warmth of Jimmy Webb's beloved Land's End period. The sublime resignation of \"No Education\", a beautifully slow number that begins, \"Never read a book in my life/ But I feel just fine\" is post-rock ballad heaven. Arriving towards the end, the title track arrives as a majestic suite; moving from a horn-and-guitar-led instrumental via shifting melodies to Hayes' compelling vocal bursts. An album of such brilliance, Fed can comfortably sit alongside such staggering statement pieces as David Bowie's Young Americans, Randy Newman's 12 Songs or Harry Nilsson's Nilsson Schmilsson. Indeed, for all the sprawling elements that went in - lengthy guitar builds, exploding horn sections, solemn strings, female backup chorus - it is a deeply personal and original record. Employing a distinct \"more is more\" aesthetic, he demonstrates remarkable restraint in producing an album of such intimacy. \"My creation has drowned me,\" he memorably sings on languid opener \"Whose Blues\", yet he navigates the shifting styles and ideas with enviable ease."

 "More Info": "Born as Florian Fricke's brainchild, Popol Vuh needs little introduction, the band stayed active between the late 1960s & late 1990s (until Florian's passing in 2001). Regarded as pioneers in avant-garde German electronic music, their early works practically laid down the foundations for 'Kosmische Muzik' (Space Music) with the then new sounds of the Moog synthesizer joined with ethnic percussions. Later the group evolved to include all kinds of instruments (both electric and acoustic alike) shrouding their music in a spiritual & introspective mystical aura. Popol Vuh influenced many other European bands with their uniquely soft but elaborate instrumentation, which took inspiration from the music of Tibet, Africa and pre-Columbian America. With music sometimes described as \"ethereal\", they created soundscapes through psychedelic walls of sound, and are regarded as precursors of contemporary 'world music', as well as of 'new age' and 'ambient'. Popol Vuh regularly contributed soundtracks to the films of Werner Herzog that include classics like 'Aguirre', 'Nosferatu', 'Heart Of Glass' & 'Cobra Verde'. Messa di Orfeo is Popol Vuh's twenthieth and last album, released in 1999 and features music played during the audio-video-light installation as performed in the Labyrinth of Molfetta (Bari-Italy). What makes this album so special is the fact that Popol Vuh were a group that almost never performed live as Florian Fricke didn't feel it would be possible to sustain the level of intensity needed for a full concert, and he preferred to spend the time he would have taken touring with writing and recording. With this unique album, POPOL VUH adds another major work to its constant search for the fusion of mysticism and music. Healing energy via sound (that are very reminiscent of the ambient pieces on Fitzcarraldo and Cobra Verde) makes these recordings spine-tinglingly beautiful. Now, for the FIRST TIME ON VINYL (these recordings only received a limited CD release in the late nineties) OWS records proudly presents a deluxe color vinyl edition exclusively for Record Store Day 2018. Strictly limited to 1000 copies worldwide this release also comes with an insert containing lyrics, liner notes and rare photographic materials. Available in participating stores on 4/21."

 "More Info": "Jamaican ska originators' Grammy0nominated 1994 album available for the first time on vinyl. Recorded 30 years after the breakup of the original Skatalites, \"Hi-Bop Ska\" finds the band's blend of R&B, jazz, and Afro-Caribbean music continuing to sound healthy and exuberant. Throughout the 1990s, the band's studio/live ranks ranged from newcomers to survivors of the band's classic 1960s lineup, including saxmen Tommy McCook and Roland Alphonso, bassist Lloyd Brevett, drummer Lloyd Knibbs, and vocalist Doreen Shaffer. The Skatalites are joined here by several prominent guests including fellow Jamaican legends Toots Hibbert (of Toots & the Maytals) and Prince Buster; jazz improvisers Lester Bowie on trumpet, saxman David Murray, trombonist Steve Turre, and Jamaican pianist Monty Alexander. The jazzers get plenty of room to shine on this mostly instrumental album, from Alexander's \"Renewal\" and Murray's \"Flowers for Albert\" to remakes of iconic 60's ska anthems \"Man in the Street\", \"Guns of Navarone\", \"You're Wondering Now\", and \"Ska Ska Ska\". \"Hi Bop Ska\" harkens back to the heyday of Jamaican independence, when the freedom sounds of ska ruled the dancehalls. These dozen songs are an essential journey for fans who discovered ska from it's Third Wave (Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Toasters, Mephiskapheles) and Second Wave (The Specials, Madness, English Beat), but is also a wonderful addition to the band's short lived 1960's output on Studio 1 and Island Records."

 "More Info": "Melvin Sparks (1946–2011) was a talented American Soul Jazz, Hard Bop & Blues guitarist. The Texas native picked up a guitar at age 11 and was only 13 when he sat in with B.B. King. As a high school student first he joined Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, and then the Upsetters (a touring band formed by Little Richard, which also backed Curtis Mayfield, Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye). Sparks and his guitar were very much in demand during the ‘60s-‘70s and he was featured on sessions by Lonnie Smith, Charles Earland, Lou Donaldson & Sonny Phillips among others. During his career Mr. Sparks recorded multiple albums for renowned labels such as Prestige & Savant and worked as a session musician for Blue Note Records. Melvin Sparks' songs were sampled countless times by DJ's and Hip-Hop outfits (including Grandmaster Flash) over the decades. In 1973 Sparks moved into funkier directions and joined the Westbound/Eastbound family where he recorded an all time classic: ‘TEXAS TWISTER'. This record is a delight and there's A LOT happening while Sparks is peeling off some fluid lightning riffs! Texas Twister features Idris Muhammad on drums, which means a frenzy of funky JB-influenced over-the-top soul-jazz drumming. Featured on Hammond Organ is the great Ceasar Frazier and bass duties are handled by Wilbur Bascomb (know for his performance on Jeff Beck's ‘Wired' album and the soundtrack for the 1979 film version of Hair). Add some extremely tight horns and congas to the mix (which gives this album a sweet Latin Jazz vibe) and you're swinging all night long. All of the above is carefully overseen by engineer Malcolm Addey & producer Bob Porter (known for their work with Quincy Jones, Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis, Coltrane etc). Originally released in 1973 on Eastbound Records, super rare and fetching large sums on the collectors market, now finally back available as a limited deluxe vinyl edition (1500 copies) featuring the original art by Neil Terk (known for his work for Muddy Waters, Dire Straits, Funkadelic, Grace Jones etc), released exclusively for Record Store Day 2018 and only available in participating record stores on 4/21."

Before dropping his debut full-length Spice 1 dropped an EP in '91 on California Indy label Triad Records. The EP peaked at # 69 on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart, no small feat. With sales this brisk, he was picked up by Jive Records and this, his self-titled debut, was issued the next year. Week one sales were disappointing, but that all turned around the following week with 900,000 scans, a Gold record and a permanent spot in Bay Area Hip Hop history.

The film is a crime thriller that follows a botched plot to kidnap the daughter of a small business owner, the plan having been to use the ransom money to pay for a kidney transplant. When the child is accidentally killed, the situation flies out of control as the plot unfolds unpredictably. The film portrays the aspects of human psychology as the protagonists are pulled into the maelstrom, while also focusing on the nature of evil. The soundtrack was provided by UhUhBoo Project, an experimental unit by Hyun-jin Baek (singer) and Young-gyu Jang (producer / bass) who seek to fuse local traditional music with avant-garde /contemporary rock. This is an astounding soundtrack that includes several experimental tracks that fully embody the unique style of UhUhBoo, as well as some folk songs and contemporary pieces. The soundtrack, which was released at the same time as the film, was sold out almost immediately. This left no more copies in circulation, making it nearly impossible to find in its entirety.

 "More Info": "Official Record Store Day release. Deluxe edition limited to 1,000 copies. Red wax housed in a deluxe gatefold \"tip-on\" jacket. Includes 18x24 film poster. First time on CD and first ever LP reissue. \"Lenin believed that the revolution would be fought with the camera and that the minds would be won in a theater rather than a battlefield. When you go to a dark theater, you're giving yourself to that screen and wanting to believe, and if it's done well, you do believe.\" – Dennis Hopper. After the incredible success of the film Easy Rider, Dennis Hopper was given a blank check to direct and star in the bizarre, surrealist The Last Movie – released in 1971. Filmed in Peru with Hopper, Peter Fonda, Kris Kristofferson, Dean Stockwell, Michelle Phillips and others – Hopper then brought the raw footage to his home in Taos, New Mexico for editing and final cut. And that's where the real fun began - fueled by drugs, guns, and orgies – all captured on film by director Lawrence Schiller in a 1971 documentary titled The American Dreamer – that has to be seen to be believed. The soundtrack features exclusive recordings by Gene Clark, John Buck Wilkin, John Manning, Hello People, and a Fred Neil cover – all produced by Nick Venet (known for his work with Beach Boys, Karen Dalton, Scott Walker, etc). Dennis Hopper archivist Jessica Hundley has written a lengthy essay about the film & soundtrack – including new interviews with director Larry Schiller, some of the musicians and others involved, while the booklet also features dozens of rare, unseen photos from the New Mexico madness that we've printed in full color in a large booklet."

 "More Info": "Strange Disc Records proudly presents the original soundtrack to one of THE groundbreaking films of African American cinema, Ganja & Hess (1973). Ganja & Hess is a seminal work of African American cinema, flirting with the conventions of blaxploitation and horror cinema, Bill Gunn's revolutionary independent film is a highly stylized and utterly original treatise on sex, religion, and African American identity. Starring Duane Jones (Night Of The Living Dead) & Marlene Clark (Midnight Cowboy, Enter The Dragon) as the leading roles. Ganja & Hess was honored as one of the ten best American films of its decade by the Cannes Film Festival but was barely distributed to American audiences. Commissioned at a time when ‘blaxploitation' movies like ‘Shaft' played as blockbusters in African American neighborhoods, it was suppressed in the United States because it did not turn out to be the Hollywood genre film the producers intended. They wanted a film that would exploit African American audiences — a black version of white vampire films— so Ganja & Hess was withdrawn the when Gunn went beyond the vampire genre and turned in an original product. The original cut was donated to the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) whose restoration work & screenings helped build the film's reputation as a negelected classic of independent African American cinema. The restored version later received a superior DVD & Blu Ray release through Kino Lorber and in 2014 the film was remade by Spike Lee as ‘Da Sweet Blood of Jesus'. The soundtrack to this exceptional film was composed Sam Waymon, a creative legend who has contributed to local, national and world culture. Born in North Carolina, Sam Waymon began his musical odyssey playing along with his sister, Eunice. His sister left North Carolina in the '50s and traveled north to pursue her career. Along the way she dropped her given name and became one of music's most influential and independent musicians, known as Nina Simone. Sam performed with and wrote music for his sister for over ten years but finally broke away to develop a style of his own that combines gospel, R&B, blues and jazz. Sam went on to record for record labels like: RCA, Polygram, and his own label Resolution records. He has worked side by side with legendary artists such as Miles Davis, Donnie Hathaway, Roberta Flack, The 5th dimension, and the list goes on and on. Even more haunting than the film is its music, Sam Waymon created an innovative, ahead-of-its-time mixture of soul, tribal chants, gospel and trippy, dissonant experimental cues that makes for the strangest score for a vampire film. Now, for the FIRST TIME ON VINYL (or on any format) Strange Disc records proudly presents a deluxe color vinyl edition exclusively for Record Store Day 2018. Curated and supervised by composer Sam Waymon himself, this release is strictly limited to 1000 copies worldwide & available in participating stores on 4/21."

 "More Info": "David Axelrod delivered one of the great psychedelic albums with 1968's Song of Innocence, based around the poetry of William Blake. It is considered by many his masterpiece. Song of Innocence is this weird hybrid that no one, not even Axelrod himself, could ever really describe. The listener is pulled in by his melodies, simplistic at first blush, but colored by odd chord progressions and turn arounds, grounded by the drummer Earl Palmer and Carol Kaye's funk, torn between the juxtaposition of musical elements – a jazz vibraphone solo here, a fuzz guitar tear here, a nod to the baroque in Don Randi's clavichord comps – and put at ease, always, by Axe's arrangements, which utilize brass and strings in a way that no 1960s arranger did. It's worth noting that there are really count-on-your-hand examples of anything that might even be compared to Song of Innocence. Perhaps Arthur Verocai's self-titled and only artist album, issued on the Brasilian Continental label in 1972, or the collaborations between Serge Gainsbourg and Jean Claude Vannier, which found their epitome in 1971's Histoire de Melody Nelson. But even these albums, superb, in any thinking music fan's canon of the best from this era, perhaps in their lives - and perhaps in line with Song of Innocence - are one-offs. Axelrod's Song of Innocence set in path a series of artist albums on Capitol and other labels and influenced the world countless times over, from The Verve to DJ Shadow to Madlib to J.Dilla. Remastered from the original tapes in a new transfer, with extensive liner notes and unpublished photos."

It's become a cult classic and been sampled by artists such as The Black Keys, Royce Da 5'9, The Roots, and Snow. (It's believed that Jay-Z also recorded a track featuring the sample which has never been released.) Formed by two session musicians from Stax Records (Archie Turner, Cornell McFadden)  and two session musicians from Hi Records (Willie Pettis, Kurt Dudley), Blackrock appeared for a short time on the Memphis music scene, and it's believed that they first performed at the 1970 Memphis Country Blues Festival at what was then the Overton Park Shell, sharing the line-up with Sid Selvidge, Electric Blues Watermelon, Furry Lewis and Bukka White, among others. They recorded two incredible sides of a 45 single for the Select-O-Hits label in North Memphis. \"Yeah, Yeah\" was an amazing slab of funk with a rock-hard foundation of drumming provided by McFadden. The flip side \"Bad Cloud Overhead\" was more dark and foreboding, with lyrics about the drug culture and \"gettin busted.\" Both singles were edited out of a longer continuous performance that had been recorded. Both appear on this RSD 2018 release, along with an extended version of \"Yeah, Yeah\" and an unreleased track."

Balancing American funk sensibilities with heavy African rhythms, Buari has become a rare and expensive treasure for record collectors.  Now, for the first time in years, this classic LP is back in print on limited-edition vinyl."

 "More Info": "The Animals. What can one say about the Animals? Out of sight? That's old. That they fly? They've been flying since they began. That they're great. This record proves it. Well, if one were looking for things to say, one could say that everything is better about this album, especially the recording of vocals and drums. But, of course, the only real question is, how is Eric? Eric is, of course, in orbit (he's also the lead vocalist, for those of you who aren't Animals fans). The whole of side one is an uninterrupted symphony of R&B. Just listen to the two versions of the absurdly great \"C. C. Rider\". On the other hand (also on the other side, side two) is most of their psychedelic material. Compared to the previous Animals albums, this just seems to pack a little more punch than any of the others with the possible exception of Animal Tracks. Jenkins's drumming really makes a difference in the overall sound. The group seems freer now, especially on the uptempo material (check \"Shake, Rattle And Roll\"). And Burdon's vocals seem to be constantly improving, which is a crucial point. I can think of nothing he has done previously to equal \"Tobacco Road\" or \"When I Was Young.\" In any event, the fact is that this album rocks. And when the Animals rock, no one can touch them. My one hope is that there is enough material in the can to put out another album as good as this one. Limited to 2000 copies worldwide."

Acclaimed artist Common was among the first successful rappers from elsewhere, officially putting Chicago on the hip-hop map with this debut album Can I Borrow A Dollar?.  Released in 1992, the album is a vintage boom-bap masterpiece, with famed producer No I.D. behind the boards on 12 of 13 tracks.  It also marks the beginning of a storied career, as Common would go on to release three gold albums, create classics with the likes of J Dilla and Kanye West, win multiple Grammys and even an Academy Award, and land several major roles as an actor.  Long out-of-print, Can I Borrow A Dollar? is now back on 2LP vinyl while supplies last.  This 25th anniversary edition also includes a bonus 7\" featuring the rare B-side \"Can-I-Bust\" and the instrumental for the single \"Breaker 1/9\"."

Taking their name from the album \"A Rainbow in Curved Air\" by American composer Terry Riley, Curved Air's debut album perfectly demonstrated the band's innovative musical approach, blending classical, electronic and folk music influences in their work and featuring Sonja Kristina's sublime vocals. Featuring such classic tracks as 'It Happened Today', 'Propositions', 'Vivaldi' and 'Situations', \"Air Conditioning\" was a Top Ten hit in the UK and firmly established Curved Air as one of Britain's foremost progressive bands. Issued as THE first rock picture disc LP on its original release, this new picture disc edition has been cut at Abbey Road Studios and is a fitting tribute to a classic album by a legendary band."

 "More Info": "The producer's own mixes – recently rediscovered - of his seminal EP, expanded with bonus tracks into a 2LP set, with extensive liner notes and unpublished photos. When Ruff Draft saw its initial release in 2003, J Dilla possessed production skills on par with anyone in hip-hop – technically and creatively. \"At the top of his game,\" says longtime friend and collaborator, Karriem Riggins. After years of building while modestly deferring to others of both greater and lesser notoriety, Dilla finally completed the first solo endeavor on his own label, entirely on his own terms. The significance of such an autonomous success often gets overlooked, and partly accounts for why Ruff Draft is one of the lesser-referenced entries in Dilla's oeuvre. \"It's a mysterious little project,\" says his mother, Maureen Yancey. \"But out of his entire career, that was the happiest time.\" Prior to recording the EP, Dilla found himself at a crossroads. Estranged from his label, MCA, and separated from the mother of his youngest daughter, frustration abounded both personally and professionally. Dilla spent parts of 2002 and 2003 working on an album for MCA that featured his rapping over contributions from other producers with whom he had connected and whose music he respected. At the time, he was known primarily for his beats, yet reviled for his MCing by most anyone not from his hometown of Detroit. The project was to be an intentional freak of the industry. The project would go on to spur his collaborative album with Madlib, Jaylib, and would first showcase the template that he would take to his greatest heights with 2006's Donuts. The Stones Throw reissue of Ruff Draft from 2008 featured remixes of the songs from the album, done without Dilla's involvement. This version of the album takes Dilla's recently discovered mixes of the album and restores his vision for the project. \"Straight from the mothafuckin' cassette,\" as he phrased the sound he was going for on the EP's intro. It is buttressed by unreleased tracks and is presented in two versions: LP one is the EP as it was originally released; LP 2 is the alternate version that Dilla had for the project. Author Ronnie Reese expands upon his original liner notes to further tell Dilla's story, in a booklet complete with never before published photographs from the Ruff Draft photo session."

The vibe of the EP is somewhat dark, contrary to the warm and carefree lifestyle one would expect of someone living in California. This may very well be a reflection of the bleak underside of fame & excess in Hollywood​.​ The EP is much more than just a handful of tracks​; it's an introspective body of work.  Diplo has recruited industry heavyweights and newcomers alike, including Santigold, Dram, Lil' Yachty, MØ, Goldlink and more, as well as LA-based artist, February James, who was commissioned to create inspired portraits of each of the artists that appear on the EP, housed in the gatefold jacket."

 "More Info": "​One of America's greatest, most influential, and legendary cult bands, who came out of the San Francisco area in 1965. They were part of the flower-power scene but their music, 3-minute power-pop blasts, wasn't. Despite playing the wrong kind of music at the wrong time, and not looking the part by sporting British Invasion mop-top haircuts, they played great greasy, bluesy rock'n'roll music which has sustained a career for three decades. Their 1968 self-produced 'Supersnazz' was snapped up by Epic, then the classic albums 'Flamingo' ('70), and 'Teenage Head' ('71) appeared on Kama Sutra. In 1973, after a UK single on UA, they issued the launch single 'Grease' for SKYDOG RECORDS, run by Parisian Marc Zermati from his Open Market record shop. Followed up by 'More Grease' in '74 and a third Skydog single in '77, the punk era then brought a new appreciative audience and a hit on Sire, the classic 'Shake Some Action'. Later, a further final Skydog project came in 1981, when they recorded at Phil Spector's Gold Star Studios, remaking 'River Deep Mountain High' in the same room as Ike & Tina's original. This singles collection, mostly taken from their early 70's heyday, is packaged with original 'Grease' artwork by comix artist Vidal. The double-LP comes in a gatefold sleeve, with notes by Skydog's Marc Zermati. It also features previously unseen 1970's colour photos discovered in the Skydog archives. The album has been remastered, and with some tracks produced by Dave Edmunds at Rockpile Studios and others recorded at Spector's Gold Star Studios, 'Grease' is a mix of Groovie originals and classic pop covers and a unique spotlight into this period in their lengthy career."

 "More Info": "​\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" may not be Dave Grusin's best known or most celebrated score but, like both book and film, it's a quiet classic.\" - David Toop    Dave Grusin's cult funky soundtrack for Peter Yates' 1973 superb crime movie, 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle,' was never released at the time. It is finally out 45 years after for RSD 2018 on Wewantsounds, remastered from the original tapes with one bonus alternate take and featuring a new essay by leading UK writer and musician David Toop. Housed in a beautiful gatefold sleeve, the release also features a stunning cover by highly sought-after Alternative Movie Poster illustrator Oliver Barrett. The music composed here by Dave Grusin for this superb film is both funky and jazzy and on a par with Quincy Jones and Lalo Schifrin's best soundtracks of the early 70s. Peter Yates who had directed 'Bullitt' knew who to go for when it came to outstanding musicians and Grusin was certainly one of the best young composers in Hollywood at the time. He would sign another more famous score in 1975 with \"3 Days of the Condor\" but The Eddie Coyle soundtrack recorded two years before is even more stunning. It plays like a hypnotic slow-burning suite and is performed by the cream of the LA jazz scene including John Guerin, Chuck Rainey, Tom Scott, Bud Shank and percussionist Emil Richards.  Amazingly the score never got released on vinyl when the film first came out in 1973 and Wewantsounds are now proud to make it available on vinyl for the first time and on CD. First Ever LP release. Remastered from the original tapes with one bonus track. Liner Notes by UK journalist and musician David Toop. Gatefold Sleeve with Artwork by famed Alternative Movie Poster designer Oliver Barrett."

We're uncertain if that is suppose to refer to factions inside Laser Pace, but no matter. The album is probably the strangest pieces of wax dripped by Takoma (apart from Charlie Nothing, natch) and seems wildly out of synch with the label's presumed focus.

The demos were intended for Hidalgo's main group, Los Lobos, but producer/keyboardist Froom thought the demos were interesting enough on their own to justify a new band. With Los Lobos member Pérez, and Froom's frequent production partner Blake, Latin Playboys was formed. The group released two albums, Latin Playboys, in 1994, and Dose, in 1999. The songs \"Manifold de Amour\" and \"Forever Night Shade Mary,\" both from the 1994 self-titled debut album, are featured on the soundtrack album for the 1995 film Desperado."

Written by Gordon Lightfoot and produced by Oldham, the song features a haunting vocal by Nico, backed by beautiful orchestration arranged and conducted by David Whittaker with The Rolling Stones' Brian Jones on guitar with Jimmy Page. Two promotional films were shot by Peter Whitehead, one featuring Nico wandering through London's West India Docks in 1965, an area long since changed. The song was chosen by Morrissey as a Desert Island Discs choice on BBC Radio Four. The gatefold sleeve features photography by Gered Mankowitz from the original recording session. The original b-side The Last Mile was a co-write between Oldham and the-then Immediate Records' musical director, Jimmy Page.

 "More Info": "​34th anniversary edition, original release from 1984 on Durium Records. Mannequin Records is proud to present a trilogy of reissues from the avantgarde Italian-born producer Doris Norton, \"Norton Computer For Peace\" (1983), \"Personal Computer\" (1984), \"Artificial Intellingence\" (1985). Apple's first music \"endorsement\" and Roland affiliate, Doris Norton is one of the most important women pioneer in the use of synths and in the early electro / computer music. Norton is the wife of Antonio Bartoccetti, progressive rock guitarist, and mother of the musician and techno producer Rexanthony.  As a teenager, she was drawn to medieval, Renaissance and Baroque music, not to mention quantum physics, differential equations, organic chemistry, the experimentalism of John Cage and animated movie soundtracks. Her love for modules and circuits found expression through the waves of an old harmonium, the frequencies of a Minimoog, a Roland System 100M, a Roland System 700 and the ARP 2500/2600. In 1980, Norton began her solo career by recording at Fontana Studio 7, the Milan studio of the composer and musician Tito Fontana, resulting in the electronic opera \"Under Ground\".  Norton became more prolific, continuing her adventures in experimental electronics and computer music with Parapsycho (1981), Raptus (1981), Nortoncomputerforpeace (1983), PC (1984) – whose album cover prominently features Apple's colored logo – and Artificial Intelligence (1985). While the beat-oriented style of Norton's music aligns her with such global fellow-travelers as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Kraftwerk, her championing of the personal computer as a tool for self-sufficient musical creativity also connects her to more artsy musicians such as Pietro Grossi, Laurie Spiegel, and the League of Automatic Music Composers. Norton's predilection for the bright, glossy timbres of early digital instruments also recalls Hubert Bognermayr and Harald Zuschrader's bizarre 1982 one-off Erdenklang. Later, her talent and expertise attracted the attention of IBM, who in 1986 named her as an official consultant. Already the reigning queen of the Italian electronic scene, she recorded two CDs for IBM: Automatic Feeling and The Double Side Of The Science. Influenced by her son, the musician and producer Rexanthony, Norton brought her fascination with the early days of techno into the 1990s, when she released three volumes of Techno Shock on Italian trance/hardcore label Sound Of The Bomb. While her music remains largely out of print and inaccessible, Norton's early records have recently begun to receive the inevitable rediscovery treatment. \"In the late sixties I had already conceived computers as \"personal.\" I have always trusted in the benefits of  solitude; [being] alone means freedom… What's better than a \"personal\" computer for materializing ideas, by oneself\" (Doris Norton)"

Here, The Queers contribute two songs to this split 7\" with Chris Barrows Band, leader of the legendary and now defunct Pink Lincolns. The Queers cover \"Beat Your Heart Out\" originally performed by The Zeros and they have re-recorded \"Everything's OK\" which originally appeared on their 1998 album Punk Rock Confidential.  Their side of the 7\" serves as a preview of their re-recorded version of Punk Rock Confidential, which will come be out sometime in 2018. The Chris Barrows Band provides two new songs of the snotty and catchy punk that made the Pink Lincolns so popular. You can feel the franticness and rowdiness in front man Chris Barrows voice that accompany their live shows.  These two bands, in some form, have been playing on each other's records for years. Think of this record as the studio sequel to the 1994 split 7\" \"Live At Some Prick's House\" which featured The Queers and Pink Lincolns. This 7\" is an essential addition to any Queers or Barrows collection."

 "More Info": "​To celebrate Record Store Day 2018, Ohio-based Funk/Soul label Colemine Records, and the Brooklyn-based indie Hip-Hop label Coalmine Records, have teamed up for a limited-edition 7-inch release, \"Head Above Water.\" The double label venture boasts a new Soul jazz groove from the LA-based Funk/Soul collective, The Rugged Nuggets, B/W a reinterpretation of the track, flipped by Coalmine's go-to producer, Small Professor, which features blistering verses from Smoke DZA, Fly Anakin and Blu, with cuts by the incomparable DJ Revolution. Side A, as referenced on the Blue Note-flipped donuts as \"COLE SIDE,\" effortlessly demonstrates why the The Rugged Nuggets are the newest collective to carry the torch of instrumental music. Emerging from the tight-knit Los Angeles Funk/Soul community, the 7-piece live band deliver a sound on \"Head Above Water\" that's as inspired, realized and refreshing as the city landscape and culture that the musicians reside within. Side B, as noted on the buoy-themed'donut as \"COAL SIDE,\" represents a coast-to-coast Hip-Hop flight as DZA kicks things off by putting on for his hometown of Harlem in a major way. His verse is pure braggadocio-tinged flames and brimming with bars, among them his NY Jets-referencing closing line of \"I'm Broadway Joe with my mink on drag.\" After Rev shreds the first hook chock full of quotables from Mos Def, Nas, M.O.P., 50 Cent, AZ and more, Mutant Academy's Fly Anakin picks up right where DZA left off and delivers a relentless stream of rhymes. The VA native continues the stylish boasts when he spits, \"They got a warrant for my style,\" amidst a flurry of raps that demand repeated listens. That same sentiment applies to Blu's verse, which ends \"Head Above Water\" with thoughtful lyrics. The Los Angeles stalwart waxes poetic about trying to make enough bread to raise his daughter and \"teach her how to bodyslam Sgt. Slaughter\" — the perfect blend of wisdom and bravado that's made Blu a legend. This sure to be collector's item, which boasts a double-sided insert designed by Joe Buck, is now available exclusively for Record Store Day. Both the music and partnership embody the spirit of RSD, which emanates feelings of community and soul over the bullshit…cause we're all just tryin' to rise up and keep our heads above water."

 "More Info": "​Patty Smyth, both with her hit band Scandal and as a solo artist, is a true \"New Wave Queen\" and has always been, at heart, a rock and roll chick, and that's no truer today, now that she's back on the road.. If Smyth did nothing but marry New York punk poet Richard Hell (Television, Voidoids), then noted tennis punk and commentator John McEnroe, that would be amazing enough, but she's also earned both Oscar and Grammy nominations and recorded a series of hit singles and albums. Smyth was born in New York City, and had a very bohemian upbringing. Her mother managed legendary guitarist Link Wray and ran or owned several prominent Greenwich Village nightclubs, including the Gaslight, the CafÃ© Wha?. The group burst onto the scene in 1982 with a self-titled debut EP that turned out to be the best-selling EP in Columbia Records history, featuring the hit single, \"Goodbye to You,\" a #1 MTV video. Scandal included the hits \"Love's Got a Line on You\" and \"Win Some, Lose Some\" on the group's first full-length album, \"The Warrior\", released in 1984, climbing into the Top 20 on the sales chart, eventually earning RIAA-certified platinum status. \"The Warrior\" remains popular to this day, featured on the radio station Flash FM in the video game Grand Theft Auto and in the third installment of Guitar Hero, Rocks the '80s. After Scandal broke up, Smyth's hard edged vocals caused Eddie Van Halen to invite her to join Van Halen (when she was 8 months pregnant!) but she declined. The first 3 sides were recorded at the Agora Ballroom in New Haven, Ct. on July 15, 1983 and side 4 was recorded from a date at Indiana University on October 22, 1984."

After the departure of guitarist Gary Thorstensen and the release of Infrared Riding Hood, Tad, Kurt and drummer Josh Sinder are chronicled as a three piece that brought forth a powerfully dense sound and feel.

 "More Info": "By the end of 1967, the music business in the Crescent City was in a bad way, and after Cosimo Matassa's downfall, recording activity in the city fell off a cliff. As in 1966, over 400 Crescent City-recorded soul songs were issued in 1967. This number dropped to less than 100 in 1968. This was truly the end of an era. Like its predecessor album which covered 1966, this LP brings together the best soul tracks recorded in New Orleans in 1967. At this time southern soul was in the ascendant but as usual the musical background of the Crescent City – jazz, R & B, the Caribbean – ensured that music recorded there always had a rhythmic twist and arrangements all of their own. New Orleans – the joker in the soul pack for sure. No national hits here, just the sound of the streets. The heartbeat of the city."

 "Quantity": 800,
 "PhotoURL": "https://recordstoreday.com/Photo/418459071205:360",
 "More Info": "Sublime Frequencies works its way down to the tip of the Malaysian peninsula with this superb collection of Singaporean 60's beat, pop, and \"off-beat cha-cha\" classics from original vinyl 45's. These 22 supercharged beat-a-go-go tracks defy a common held belief that the Chinese couldn't rock, groove, or swing back in the 1960's. The vocals are sung in the dialects of Mandarin and Hokkien and they soar with catchy hooks atop groovy, clever beats. There's plenty of electric guitar, organ, and crazy percussion rocking and twisting behind it all, at times reaching quite a mad and freaky state of affairs. The record's finale \"Happy Lunar New Year\" sung by Linda Yong may be the weirdest New Year greeting ever recorded. Every single cut is a winner and it never lets up from start to finish. Although most of the lyrics focus on love, innocence, and festive atmospherics, there's an epic vibe to the music that rivals other extremely well-recorded and unique pop styles emanating from the surrounding Southeast Asian scenes during the late 1960's. Seminal bands of the period like The Stylers and The Silvertones are well represented here backing up a wide array of popular vocalists with Charlie Electric Guitar Band's Sound of Japan ripping it up on four brilliant instrumental tracks. This 2-LP limited edition record store day release comes with a gorgeous gatefold full-color jacket with photos of the original 45 sleeves and extended liner notes from compiler William Gibson."

 "More Info": "East LA is much more than an area located east of the Los Angeles River. Inhabited almost exclusively by Chicanos with their own way of life, there is not enough space allotted here to explain the East LA culture. Suffice it to say that back in the 60s, lowriders cruised Whittier Boulevard in old Chevys that had been customized so much that they looked as if they were from outer space yet only sit a few inches from the ground. They needed a soundtrack and it was provided by local groups like Thee Midniters, Cannibal & the Headhunters, The Blendells, The Premiers, The Ambertones and dozens others. These bands would play high school dances, union hall parties and supermarket openings; anywhere they could get a group of teenagers together and make some noise. There was a market for Chicano music ever since Richie Valens struck with ‘Come On, Let's Go' in 1957. In the 60s, East LA garages, where the bands rehearsed, were mined by record companies searching for the new sounds. Each of the bands could excel at ballad singing, as well as hard-hitting, Rolling Stones-influenced rock & roll and highly authentic soul music. One of the movers and shakers of this scene was a fellow named Eddie Davis, who started his Faro label around 1958. Faro issued mostly pop-oriented records, but also Richie Valens-influenced rockers like ‘So You Want To Rock' by Chick Carlton & The Majestics. Davis formed other labels as well, like Linda and Rampart. Davis' music enterprises really took off in 1964, when ‘La La La La' by The Blendells, ‘Farmer John' by The Premiers and ‘Land Of 1000 Dances' by Cannibal & The Headhunters all became hits. All three songs were licensed to larger companies: Warner Bros, Reprise and Date, respectively. This compilation consists of tracks from Eddie Davis' family of labels and it is evidence of the wonderful music that was made at that place, at that time, with a solid emphasis on the groove. R&B was always very important on the East Side. One of the primo music venues in the area was the El Monte Legion Stadium, which featured such fabulous acts as Don & Dewey, The Penguins, Chuck Higgins, Marvin & Johnny, Johnny Otis and Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson. Local musicians dug the shows and just about every East LA band covered the top soul hits in their live acts. Nearly every song in this box set reflects that influence. The included recordings by Sarah James & The Soul Babies, Thee Enchantments, The Majestics and Sammy Lee are among the finest soul records ever recorded, however they are never acknowledged in books about the genre. One of the best R&B records cut for Faro was ‘Tracy (All I Have Is You)' – a cool, Ray Charles-influenced stormer – by a young Barry White (his first record) backed by The Atlantics. Also featured herein are some fine, fine, super fine party records: Little Ray's ‘Come Swim With Me', The Atlantics' ‘Beaver Shot' and The Blendells' ‘Huggies Bunnies' are among them. They liked to rock on the East Side, that's for sure, and three of the tracks included here – those by The Romancers, The Premiers and Sunday Funnies – have enough beat, snarl and fuzz-toned guitars to count as garage/punk in anybody's book. No serious East LA compilation of music would be complete without a romantic soul ballad. Dig ‘One Like Mine' by The Salas Brothers with The Jaguars. PLUS, the totally grease-i-fied version of ‘Crystal Blue Persuasion' by The Invincibles, a soul trio that had been kicking around LA for at least five years (with singles on WB & Loma) before it covered the Tommy James hit in 1969. Davis continued his operations into the early 70s with Gordo. Many of the songs recorded for this label exuded new-found Chicano pride, such as ‘Via Tirado' by El Chicano and especially the two included here by Willie G with Six Pack and Two Tons of Love. Soon after, Eddie Davis lost interest in the music business. However, music lovers have most definitely NOT lost interest in the music Eddie Davis recorded. Here are 20 songs jam-packed with the grease and the grit – and mostly the soul – of East LA. - Phast Phreddie Patterson"
